# TheGitLabAnalyser

Before starting the analysis, check if a file named token_info.json lies in the same directory as the main file. Insert in this file your GitLab Url and a valid GitLab API token.
You can find information about how to create such a token here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html.
If the token is available and set you can start the main.exe.
To start the analysis enter your GitLab repositorys home URL (e.g. https://your-gitlab-repo-url.de/).
